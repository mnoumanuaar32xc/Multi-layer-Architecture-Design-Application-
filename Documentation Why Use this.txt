The repository pattern is a design pattern used in software development to abstract the data access layer from the rest of the application. 
The main idea behind the repository pattern is to create an interface that defines the operations that can be done on a data source (e.g. a database). This interface is then implemented by one or more classes that handle the actual data access logic.
By using the repository pattern, the application can be decoupled from the specific implementation of the data source. This allows for easy swapping of different data sources (e.g. from a SQL database to a NoSQL database) without affecting the rest of the application. It also makes the code more testable, as the data access logic can be easily mocked or replaced with a fake implementation for testing purposes.
Overall, the repository pattern provides a clear separation between the data access logic and the rest of the application, making the code more modular, maintainable, and testable. It is commonly used in applications that have to deal with
